# Machine Learning

### Data
Data for the machine learning models is in the kaggle_data folder. These files were taken from Kaggle.  
The framework used is Tensorflow. Data analysis and cleaning is done through the Pandas library. Plotting and graphs is done through Matplotlib.

## Kaggle ML
### LungProj - Lung Cancer Detection
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to predict whether an x-ray image of a lung is cancerous or not.  
The dataset is public and was taken from Kaggle.

### SkinCancerProj - Skin Cancer Detection and Classification
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify skin images into multiple classes, including various types of skin cancer.
It is currently a work in progress.
The dataset is public and was taken from Kaggle.

### ASLProj - American Sign Language Recognition
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to match ASL hand signs to their alphabetical meaning (A-Z).  
This is currently a work in progress.
The dataset is public and was taken from Kaggle.
